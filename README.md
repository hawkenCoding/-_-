# `-_-`

A Discord bot made using discord.py. Made for educational purposes. A collaborative effort open to everyone, especially members of the Hawken Coding Club, that was started by [21taoray](https://github.com/rtao258).

### Name

If you are having trouble with the name `-_-`, you may also refer to the bot as `dashunderscoredash` (or `dud` for short).

## Using the Bot

The bot will soon be live on the Hawken Coding Club Discord. You must be a member of the Discord server to use the bot. Unfortunately, we will not be making the bot available for other servers, since it is meant for internal educational purposes. However, you are free to clone the repository and host the bot yourself for your own servers per the terms of the [license](LICENSE).


### HCC Server Details

The bot will be hosted off of Heroku - if you have an idea for a better platform, let us know. If you're a club admin and require access to the secret key, ask for it on the HCC Discord server.

## Working on the Bot

Thanks for your interest in making the bot better. To get started, please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](contributing.md) file.
